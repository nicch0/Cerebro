# Cerebro - Obsidian-first, AI-powered second brain that thinks with you

Cerebro is an Obsidian-first LLM integration that transforms your vault into an intelligent workspace. Chat with AI from any note, process PDFs, analyze images, and fetch web content - all while maintaining Obsidian's philosophy of plain text files and local-first data.
